Program Review InterNet Colletor Engine Screen Scraper

June provides a service together with June's partner Lucidity where customers such as blockbuster.dk can get access to quotes and ratings for movies and TV series that they offer their end customers via their OTT services, ie via web services and apps. The quotes and ratings increase the chance for viewers to find something they want to see and also give the service legitimacy as it is a third party who has rated the content. Quotes and ratings are provided via an API.
At present, there are no direct administration options for quotes and the quotes and reviews that are to be submitted are entered into the service in a cumbersome manner.
